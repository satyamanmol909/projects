/*
1. ENCAPSULATION : It is a concept of OOPS in which the data and methods are bound together in a single CLASS/UNITE

== class/unite(data + related function )===encapsulation

2. ABSTRACTION : It is a concept of OOPS in which we show only necessary information to
                    the outside world and hide the internal details.

            1.SINGLE INHERITANCE :CHILD CLASS INHERIT FROM SINGLE PARENT CLASS
            2.MULTIPLE INHERITANCE :more than one parent class the some child class
            3.MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE :1 drived class inherit from another drived class
            4.HIERARCHICAL INHERITANCE : only one parent class and more than one child class
            5.HYBRID INHERITANCE: more than one parent class and more than one child class

 4. POLYMORPHISM :
